# About

In Javascript array size, array insertion and array deletion are not limitations
hence linked lists are not really necessary. The only purpose of this project is
for practicing on data structures.

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements called nodes that “point”
to the next node by means of a pointer.

Each node holds a single element of data and a link or pointer to the next node
in the list. A head node is the first node in the list, a tail node is the last
node in the list.

## Languages

- `JavaScript`

## Tools

- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/): Node.js® is an open-source, cross-platform
  JavaScript runtime environment
- [`ESLint`](https://eslint.org/): Linter that statically analyzes the
  JavaScript code to quickly find problems
- [`Prettier`](https://prettier.io/): Prettier is an opinionated code formatter.
  It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with
  its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code
  when necessary
